### Commit Messages
All commits contain the suitable prefix. Acceptable prefixes:
- `chore`: A tech task that's not actually a feature but still needs to be done (e.g. test integration with a 3rd-party service)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
